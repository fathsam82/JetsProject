# JetsProject
An airfield was populated with Jets at the start of the program. The application would display a menu to the user, where they could choose from 9 options. The fist option, the user could list all of the Jets and their information. The second gave them an option to fly all of the Jets and display the maximum fly time each jet was capable of. The third option, the user could view the fastest jet. The fourth option, the user could view the jet with the longest range. The fifth and sixth option, allowed the user to perform specific behaviors for certain jets. The seventh option allowed the user to add a jet to the fleet. The eighth option gave them an option to remove a jet from the fleet. The last option allowed the user to quit the program. 
# Description
I accepted user input to choose from a variety of menu options, from which I placed each menu option within a switch statement where I called on specific methods that were stored within my airfield class. I read in the jet information from a text file and stored it within an array list called hangar. I was then able to reference hangar within the methods to calculate the desired output, using the available information. 

# Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclipse

# Lessons Learned
I learned about using an object's declaration within methods. 
I reinforced my understanding of calling on methods. 
I learned about reading in information from a text file and converting that information from Strings to specific data types.
I reinforced my understanding of within methods, casting the data received from separate classes, to be usable for a calculation. 
I learned about interfaces and the role they play.
