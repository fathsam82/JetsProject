# JetsProject
I wanted to build and app where the user was able to chose from a variety of menu options. Depending on their output, I wanted to 
list the fleet of jets that were stored in the airfield and provide their information. The user could also fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load all cargo jets, perform action with the fighterjets and cargojets, remove jets from the fleet while and add jets to the fleet.
